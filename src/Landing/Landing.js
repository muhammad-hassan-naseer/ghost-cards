            After the end of the 100 year war, there was no winner. Great
            warriros gathered on the battlefield to defeattheir enemy. In the
            moment of combat, a powerful spell shattered the battlefield and lit
            the ground with crimson light. When the light went out, only the
            wandering souls of the fallen were left on the field.
